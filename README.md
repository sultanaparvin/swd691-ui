# Website Testing Dashboard - User Interface

"Website Testing Dashboard" project centralizes the software testing process. This project allows the testing team and development team to have access to the test cases at the same time. It also allows other parties such as managers to check the progress of the tests and fixes. By keeping the data centralized we can avoid various revisions, file transfer process and decrease the error.

This repository serves as a codebase for development of a user interface for "Website Testing Dashboard" project. User interface is the presentation layer of the project. System users directly interact with this layer.
